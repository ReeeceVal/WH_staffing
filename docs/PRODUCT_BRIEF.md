# Restaurant Staff Availability System - Product Brief

## Project Overview / Description

A minimal viable product (MVP) web application designed to collect and manage restaurant staff availability. The system provides a simple interface for staff members to input their weekly availability, including specific time slots for each day they're available to work. The application focuses on ease of use and quick data collection without complex authentication or database systems.

## Target Audience

- **Primary**: Restaurant staff members who need to communicate their weekly availability
- **Secondary**: Restaurant managers/owners who need to collect and organize staff scheduling data
- **Use Case**: Small to medium-sized restaurants requiring a simple, no-frills solution for staff scheduling coordination

## Primary Benefits / Features

### Core Functionality
- **Simple Authentication**: Staff name + unique PIN entry system (no complex user management)
- **Weekly Availability Selection**: Checkbox interface for selecting available days (Tuesday-Sunday)
- **Time Slot Configuration**: Interactive sliding timeline for each selected day to specify working hours
- **Data Export**: CSV export functionality for easy data management and integration

### Key Benefits
- **Minimal Setup**: No database configuration or complex deployment requirements
- **User-Friendly**: Intuitive interface requiring minimal training
- **Quick Implementation**: MVP approach allows for rapid deployment and iteration
- **Data Portability**: CSV export enables easy integration with existing scheduling systems

## High-Level Tech/Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js or Vue.js for interactive UI components
- **Styling**: CSS/Tailwind for responsive design and sliding timeline animations
- **State Management**: Local state management for form data and availability selections

### Backend & Deployment
- **Platform**: Vercel for hosting and serverless functions
- **Data Storage**: File-based CSV export (no database required)
- **API**: Simple serverless functions for data processing and CSV generation

### Technical Considerations
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach for staff accessibility
- **Client-Side Processing**: Minimal server dependencies for MVP
- **Static Generation**: Optimized for Vercel's static hosting capabilities
- **CSV Generation**: Browser-side or serverless function for data export

### Future Scalability
- Architecture designed to easily add database integration if needed
- Modular design allows for feature expansion (notifications, manager dashboard, etc.)
- Simple authentication system can be enhanced with proper user management later
