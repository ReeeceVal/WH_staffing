# Mobile Testing Updates for Landing Portal

## Brief Description

Update the landing portal authentication form based on mobile testing feedback. Add an explicit "Enter" button for form submission and implement automatic focus progression for PIN input fields to improve mobile user experience.

## Technical Requirements

### Current State Analysis
- Landing portal has employee name dropdown and 5-digit PIN input with individual blocks
- Current submit button is labeled "Sign In" 
- PIN blocks require manual clicking to move between fields
- Form submission is handled via form submit event

### Required Changes

#### 1. Submit Button Update
- **File**: `index.html` (lines 98-103)
- **Change**: Update button text from "Sign In" to "Enter"
- **Location**: Submit button within the authentication form

#### 2. Automatic PIN Focus Progression
- **File**: `script.js` (lines 173-187)
- **Function**: `handlePinBlockInput(event, index)`
- **Current Behavior**: Only moves to next block if current block has a value
- **Required Change**: Automatically focus next PIN block immediately when a digit is entered, regardless of whether the current block has a value
- **Implementation**: Modify the focus logic to trigger on any valid numeric input

#### 3. Enhanced PIN Input Logic
- **File**: `script.js` (lines 173-187)
- **Current Logic**: 
  ```javascript
  if (value && index < pinBlocks.length - 1) {
      pinBlocks[index + 1].focus();
  }
  ```
- **New Logic**: Move focus immediately when a digit is entered, ensuring smooth mobile experience
- **Edge Cases**: Handle backspace navigation and maintain existing paste functionality

### Implementation Details

#### PIN Focus Progression Algorithm
1. User enters a digit in any PIN block
2. System immediately moves focus to the next available PIN block
3. If user is on the last block, focus remains on current block
4. Backspace behavior remains unchanged (moves to previous block if current is empty)
5. Paste functionality continues to work as before

#### Button Text Update
- Simple text change from "Sign In" to "Enter" in the HTML
- No functional changes to the button behavior
- Maintains existing styling and event handling

### Files to Modify

#### `index.html`
- **Line 102**: Change button text from "Sign In" to "Enter"

#### `script.js`
- **Lines 173-187**: Update `handlePinBlockInput` function to implement automatic focus progression
- **Focus Logic**: Modify the conditional that determines when to move to the next PIN block

### Testing Considerations
- Verify automatic focus works on mobile devices
- Ensure backspace navigation still functions correctly
- Test paste functionality remains intact
- Confirm form submission works with new "Enter" button text
- Validate that the user experience is smoother on mobile devices

### Dependencies
- No new dependencies required
- Uses existing DOM manipulation and event handling
- Maintains compatibility with current authentication flow
