# Feature 0002: Availability Selection Page

## Description
Create an availability selection page that displays the employee's name in the top bar, shows a date range for shift submission based on the current date (from next Tuesday to Sunday), and provides a horizontal bar with checkboxes for each day of the week (Tuesday through Sunday) labeled as "Days available".

## Technical Requirements

### Date Range Logic
The date range calculation works as follows:
- From TODAY's day/date, the date range will be from the next Tuesday to Sunday
- Example: If today is Sunday 07/09/2025, the date range will be "Tuesday, 9 Aug - Sunday, 14 Aug"
- The system must calculate the next Tuesday from the current date and extend to the following Sunday

### UI Components Required

#### 1. Top Bar with Employee Name
- Display the authenticated employee's full name (name + surname from CSV data)
- Position at the top of the page below the logo section
- Use consistent styling with the existing navy theme

#### 2. Date Range Display
- Show the calculated date range in a readable format
- Format: "Tuesday, 9 Aug - Sunday, 14 Aug" (day name, day number, month abbreviation)
- Position below the employee name

#### 3. Days Available Selection Bar
- Horizontal bar element with checkboxes for each day
- Days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
- Label: "Days available"
- Each checkbox should be clickable and visually distinct
- Use consistent styling with the existing design system

## Files to Modify

### 1. availability.html
- Replace the placeholder content with the new availability selection interface
- Add top bar section for employee name display
- Add date range display section
- Add horizontal checkbox bar for days selection
- Maintain existing logo and back button functionality

### 2. script.js (new functions needed)
- Add `calculateDateRange()` function to determine next Tuesday to Sunday range
- Add `formatDateRange()` function to format dates for display
- Add `getEmployeeName()` function to retrieve and display employee name
- Add `setupAvailabilityPage()` function to initialize the availability page
- Add event listeners for day selection checkboxes
- Add `handleDaySelection()` function to manage checkbox state

### 3. styles.css (new styles needed)
- Add `.employee-name-bar` class for top bar styling
- Add `.date-range-display` class for date range styling
- Add `.days-available-section` class for the checkbox container
- Add `.day-checkbox` class for individual day checkboxes
- Add `.day-checkbox:checked` styles for selected state
- Ensure responsive design for mobile devices

## Algorithm for Date Range Calculation

1. Get current date
2. Calculate days until next Tuesday:
   - If today is Sunday (0): next Tuesday is in 2 days
   - If today is Monday (1): next Tuesday is in 1 day
   - If today is Tuesday (2): next Tuesday is in 7 days (next week)
   - If today is Wednesday (3): next Tuesday is in 6 days
   - If today is Thursday (4): next Tuesday is in 5 days
   - If today is Friday (5): next Tuesday is in 4 days
   - If today is Saturday (6): next Tuesday is in 3 days
3. Calculate the Sunday that follows the Tuesday (5 days later)
4. Format both dates as "Day, DD MMM" format
5. Display as "Tuesday, 9 Aug - Sunday, 14 Aug"

## Data Flow
1. Page loads and calls `setupAvailabilityPage()`
2. Function retrieves employee data from session/localStorage (passed from login)
3. Function calculates date range using current date
4. Function populates employee name in top bar
5. Function displays formatted date range
6. Function sets up checkbox event listeners
7. User interactions with checkboxes are handled by `handleDaySelection()`

## Implementation Notes
- Maintain consistency with existing navy/white color scheme
- Ensure mobile responsiveness for checkbox bar
- Use semantic HTML for accessibility
- Store selected days in a data structure for future submission functionality
- Validate that employee data is available before displaying (handle edge cases)
