# Basic Website Structure and Authentication Landing Page

## Brief Description

Develop the foundational structure for the restaurant staff availability system, starting with a landing page that implements simple authentication using employee name selection and PIN validation. The system will use a CSV-based employee database and provide a mobile-first interface with the wijnhuis logo and navy/white color scheme.

## Technical Requirements

### Data Layer
- **File**: `data/users/employees.csv`
- **Structure**: CSV with columns [employee_id, name, surname, user_pin, start_employment]
- **Purpose**: Store employee authentication data for PIN validation

### Frontend Structure
- **File**: `index.html` (root landing page)
- **Framework**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Tailwind CSS
- **Components**:
  - Logo display using `media/wh_logo.png`
  - Employee name dropdown with search functionality (appears when typing)
  - 5-digit PIN input field
  - Authentication validation logic
  - Mobile-responsive design with navy/white color scheme

### Authentication Flow
1. User types in name dropdown to search and select employee
2. User enters 5-digit PIN
3. System validates PIN against CSV data
4. On successful validation, redirect to next page (placeholder for now)
5. On failed validation, display error message

### Styling Requirements
- **Color Scheme**: White background with navy accents
- **Logo**: Display `media/wh_logo.png` at top of page
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design optimized for mobile usage
- **Minimal Look**: Clean, simple interface using Tailwind CSS

## Files to Create/Modify

### New Files
- `index.html` - Main landing page with authentication form
- `data/users/employees.csv` - Employee database with sample data
- `styles.css` - Custom Tailwind configuration and additional styles
- `script.js` - Authentication logic and form handling

### Dependencies
- Tailwind CSS (CDN or local)
- CSV parsing library for client-side validation

## Implementation Details

### Employee Data Structure
The CSV will contain sample employee data with:
- Unique employee IDs
- Full names (first and surname)
- 5-digit PINs for authentication
- Employment start dates

### Authentication Algorithm
1. Load employee data from CSV on page load
2. Implement searchable dropdown that filters employees as user types
3. Validate entered PIN against selected employee's stored PIN
4. Handle authentication success/failure states
5. Prepare for navigation to availability selection page (future feature)

### Mobile Optimization
- Touch-friendly input fields and buttons
- Responsive layout that works on small screens
- Fast loading and minimal dependencies
- Accessible form controls for mobile users
